# **Usage**

Understanding Pochi's model support and credit system helps you optimize your development workflow and manage costs effectively.

## **What models are supported**

Pochi offers multiple LLM choices to match different development needs and budget requirements. Models in the **Swift** category tend to be faster and more cost-efficient, while those in the **Super** category are better suited for handling higher-complexity tasks, though they may incur higher costs.

| Model                | Category         | Best For                                                                                          |
| :------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro**   | Super | Web development, API integration, adhering to coding standards, and complex component generation. |
| **Claude 4**         | Super | Code generation, complex reasoning, visual understanding, and full-stack development.             |
| **Kimi-K2**          | Swift | Balanced performance for most development tasks while maintaining excellent value for money.      |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Swift | Rapid prototyping, simpler development tasks, and budget-friendly projects.                       |
| **Qwen3-Coder**      | Swift | Daily software development with a goal of automation at lower budget.                             |

**Switching Models**: You can change models mid-task based on complexity requirements without losing context.

## **Pricing and Billing**

We use **Stripe** to handle all our billing and payment processing securely.

### **Free Features**

**[Tab Completion](/tab-completion)** is free for all users with no usage limits or restrictions. To prevent abuse, 
we may ask you to add a credit card if your usage exceeds a certain threshold — but don’t worry, Tab Completion feature 
will remain free.

### **Usage-Based Pricing**

Usage-based billing applies only to **Pochi Task** research and execution usage. 

Upon signing up Pochi, users would receive **$20 free usage credits** each month (renews monthly). Your usage is 
calculated based on the token cost of the LLMs you use, and we pass these costs directly through to you. We bill 
you automatically if your outstanding balance exceeds **$10**; otherwise, you are billed for any amount owed at 
the end of your monthly cycle. To help you manage your costs, you can also set a monthly spending budget on your `/profile` page.
